In this repository, directional and bidirectional connectivities were used to predict whether a given time interval is pre-ictal or inter-ictal.

## Connectivity
Information in connections: Activities in a brain are correlated to a specific mental task, which uses bunch of neurons for a biological computation that produces electromagnetic signal. In a system like human brain, the similarity between these recorded signals (electromagnetic, chemical, etc...) can give us a good information about functions of brain and later investigations about related diseases. The similarity criterion and variable normalizations finally form a weight matrix that can be transformed into a weighted graph, and if criterion is causal, a directional graph.
